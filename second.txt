POISON IN YOUR PLATE – We are what we eat.
Food poisoning is the result of consuming contaminated food and drinks. Not following hygienic rules in the process from the preparation to consumption of food, or the inappropriate storing of food, can be harmful for health. Chemical materials, natural food poisons, parasites and microorganisms can cause food illnesses and poisonings. Seventy two hours after consuming a common meal, if two or more people show similar symptoms, food poisoning can be inferred. The illness can be seen among people who are in the same place and have consumed the food, as well as among the people who consume the same contaminated food in different places.
Food poison can also happen due to adulteration of the food on commercial purpose. Nowadays due to rapid urbanisation, the land available to the farmers to cultivate the food has been decreasing drastically and the farmers have to look for ways to cultivate the crop despite the difficulties they face and the low subsidies that they receive from the government. So, the amount of pesticides and fertilisers that are sprayed are higher than the required amount necessary for the crop, which amounts to bio magnification in certain cases.
Bio magnification: Bio magnification, also known as bio amplification or biological magnification is the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic chemical, in the tissues of organisms at successively higher levels in a food chain.
Junk food is also considered, in certain cases, as the cause for food poisoning. Foods commonly considered as junk foods include salted snack foods, gum, candy, sweet desserts, fried fast food, and sugary carbonated beverages. Foods can be considered either healthy or junk food depending on their ingredients and preparation methods. The more highly processed items usually fall under junk category.
Ultimately, it depends on the health condition of the person who is taking the food. Some people may be allergic to certain kind of ingredients in the food, due to which though that particular item doesn’t harm a person, may harm the person allergic to it.
Constipation is the mother of diseases. So it is better to eat what we can digest.
The main points that I’m going to focus on the various ways that can cause food poisoning are:
By pesticides and fertilisers.
By adulteration:
1.	Milk.
2.	Honey.
3.	Spices.
4.	Ice cream.
5.	Food grains.
6.	Coffee powder.
7.	Tea leaves.
8.	Vegetable oils and ghee.
9.	Diwali sweets and many more.
By chemicals:
1.	Artificial sweeteners.
2.	MSG Symptom complex.
3.	Preservatives in pickles.
4.	Injecting of coloured fluids into fruits and vegetables.
5.	Artificially ripened fruits 
The presentation would also be about the changes that were made in the villages of India to take care about our ecological footprints and also the measures that were taken for the upbringing of farmers and to increase the organic farming.
